# Metabridge Demo

This project is a demo of the Metabridge SDK, a powerful tool for connecting blockchain networks and enabling cross-chain transactions.
Installation

To use this demo, you will need to have MetaMask installed in your browser. You can download it from the official website: https://metamask.io.

Once you have MetaMask installed, you can clone this repository and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

npm install

# Usage

To use this demo, simply open the https://test.metabridge.network/ file in your browser. You should see a page with two boxes, each containing a logo and some text.

In the first box, you can enter a string and click the "Send Message" button. This will send a message to the Ethereum Sepolia network from the Theta Testnetwork using the Metabridge SDK.

In the second box, you will see the output of the transaction. If the transaction was successful, you will see the transaction hash and other details.


# Configuration

To configure the Metabridge SDK, you can edit the config.js file in the root directory of this project. This file contains settings for the Ethereum network and other parameters.
